# Temperature-LED-Scan
Arduino Project using electronic components

The purpose of the project is to measure the temperature of the area using a DHT sensor and signaling the temperature difference through leds. When the room is above 30 celsius, the red led will light up, and when it is below 30 celsius, the blue led will light up.

The image below is the circuit board components of the project
